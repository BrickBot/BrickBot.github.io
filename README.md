# Welcome to the LEGO MindStorms RCX Hub!
The page provides an index to the repositories comprising the BrickBot organization, as well as links to related resources.

All projects imported to this GitHub organization have been curated to varying degrees as part of the import process.
Please feel free to join and contribute in whatever way you can, whether that might be cleaning up
or updating documenation, converting plain-text ReadMe files to Markdown, setting up wikis, or updating code to
work with the latest host platforms.

The initial eighty-plus (80+) projects gathered under this BrickBot organization on GitHub were largely collected by Matthew Sheets.

# RCX Hardware Accessories

## RCX Power
For RCX bricks with a power port, the LEGO recommendation was their 9V AC Adapter part # 9833.

## USB-to-Serial Adapter for the Serial IR Tower
FTDI chips generally have the best reputation, so more general advice is to look for adapters with those chips.
* [USB-to-Serial Adapter Cable by ESU](https://www.esu.eu/en/products/accessories/usb-connection-cable/) - ESU needed reliable adapters to work with the serial connections on their hardware, so they have a vested interest in ensuring that these adapters are functionally robust.

## Battery Elimination for Serial IR Tower
Due to the design of the serial IR tower, a "dummy" 9V battery is the easiest replacement.  No fees, commissions, etc. are earned with these links; other sources welcome.
* [9V Active Dummy Cell Battery with 8” Flat Flexible Cable and 5.5mm/2.1mm Barrel Socket](https://www.lightsandbatteries.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=9V-ACTIVE-DUMMY) - For use with a separate power adapter
  + [USB-A to to 2.1mm Jack with 9V Output](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2777)
  + [USB-C Power Delivery Adapter with 9V 5A Output](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5449) - The jack works with sockets having a 5.5mm outer diameter and either a 2.5mm or 2.1mm inner-diameter
  + [USB-A to 5.5mm/2.1mm Jack DC Booster Cable with Selectable 9V or 12V Output](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5457)
  + [USB-C Power Delivery Adapter with Reprogrammable Output Voltage](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5501) - The jack works with sockets having a 5.5mm outer diameter and either a 2.5mm or 2.1mm inner-diameter
* [9V Active Dummy Cell Battery with 8” Flat Flexible Cable _and_ Power Adapter](https://www.lightsandbatteries.com/product-p/9v-eliminator-kit.htm)
* [Alternative source for 9V battery eliminators](https://batteryeliminatorstore.com/collections/9-volt-battery-eliminators)  (much more expensive)
