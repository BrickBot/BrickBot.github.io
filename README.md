This BrickBot organization is dedicated to the LEGO MindStorms RCX and the development activity that grew up around it.
Here you will find repositories of RCX-related projects, as well as links to related resources.
The initial eighty-plus (80+) projects gathered under this BrickBot organization on GitHub were largely collected by Matthew Sheets.

All projects imported to this GitHub organization have been curated to varying degrees as part of the import process.
Please feel free to [join and contribute](Get-Involved.md) in whatever way you can, helping to preserve the legacy of the LEGO MindStorms RCX!
