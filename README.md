# Welcome to the LEGO MindStorms RCX Hub!
The page provides an index to the repositories comprising the BrickBot organization, as well as links to related resources.

All projects imported to this GitHub organization have been curated to varying degrees as part of the import process.
Please feel free to join and contribute in whatever way you can, whether that might be cleaning up
or updating documenation, converting plain-text ReadMe files to Markdown, setting up wikis, or updating code to
work with the latest host platforms.

The initial eighty-plus (80+) projects gathered under this BrickBot organization on GitHub were largely collected by Matthew Sheets.
