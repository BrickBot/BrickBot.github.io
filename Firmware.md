## Third-Party Firmwares

### Platforms for Creating Alternative Firmware

### Firmware for Alternate Programming Languages

[RobotC (Dick Swan)](https://github.com/BrickBot/RobotC) – Designed for programming the RCX using a C-like language

[BrickOS / Bibo](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickOS-bibo) – Designed for programming the RCX using languages supported by GCC

[pbForth](https://github.com/BrickBot/pbForth) – Designed for programming the RCX using Forth

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Firmware
[LeJOS](https://github.com/BrickBot/leJOS-RCX) – Designed for programming the RCX using Java



### “Appliance” Firmware
These firmware release can be loaded on the RCX and will run as-is, with no additional programming needed on the computer side.
[LDCC (LEGO Digital Command Control)](https://github.com/BrickBot/LDCC) – Designed for using with DCC  (DCC is typically implemented for use with model trains.)
  + Includes both Command Station and Accessory Decoder firmware
  + The Command Station capabilities have been incorporated into the latest versions of [BrickOS / Bibo](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickOS-bibo)

[OnScreen Programming](https://github.com/BrickBot/OnScreenProgramming) – Designed for on-device programing of the RCX

[Pocket Programmer](https://github.com/BrickBot/PocketProgrammer) – A more advanced and completely rewritten implemantation based on [OnScreen Programming](https://github.com/BrickBot/OnScreenProgramming)
